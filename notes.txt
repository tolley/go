Project Name: mygogames.com

Purpose: To create a website based around uploading, sorting, storing, and publishing saved go game (.sgf) files.

Phase 1

Actions:
- Create an account
- Login/Logout
- Change your password
- Upload a .sgf file
- Delete an sgf file
- Create a label
- Delete a label
- Label sgf files
- Sort the games by label, or by the following game attributes
	- Date
	- Players name/rank
	- Final score
- View any additional information like location(?).
- Share games / Make games private
- Add comments that won't be placed in the game file (Only visible on my site).
- Embeddable game browser so user's can place their game on any website.

The sharing games functionality will consist of the following:
1. User's will be able to automatically share any game they upload using an account level setting
2. User's will be able to share, or unshare, any game they upload using an override setting
3. Once a game has been shared, a page will be made accessible with the following:
	- The game browser for viewers to step through the game with
	- A forum system for comments
	- A link system so that user's can link to a certain move within the game browser.
4. User's will also be given a link to send to other people (probably an "Email This" link)


Phase 2:
The purpose of phase 2 is to build a game/page editor.  User's will be able to use the game editor
to add comments to existing uploaded games or to show alternative plays.  The page editor will be used 
to create tutorial pages.  It should be easy for the user to create mini game browser instances and 
position on the page as well as to fill out situations on the board.  The main purpose of this is to
create a resource that people can use to quickly build tutorial pages.

Distant future:
I'd like to be able to do the following:
- Create images from an sgf file.  The image could be for any given point in the game, any dimensions.
- Actually play go on my site.
- Try to create a sort of Go oriented social site (need a nice user base for this)
- Create some type of Game Review ladder system so that players can review other player's games
- Intergrate with different go servers (IGS, KGS) so that I can dynamically pull a player's rank/stats/games.
- Play against Go programs.
- A mode of viewing a game that will have some way of showing you who's territory is who's at the end of the game while you step through the game. ( maybe a magnifiying glass that on the mouse cursor that shows you the end result of whatever part of the board it is over).
